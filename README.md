## Overview:
This project consists of a Python script and a Tableau dashboard designed to analyze trade statistics between Spain and the USA. The Python script takes raw trade data from DataComex, cleans it, adds metadata such as descriptions for TARIC codes, countries, and provinces, and generates a clean CSV file. The Tableau dashboard visualizes various aspects of the trade relationship between Spain and the USA, including annual trade balance, year-over-year (YoY) comparisons of exports and imports, monthly evolution of imports and exports, and the main goods exported and imported in the current year.

## Python Script:
The Python script `data_processing.py` performs the following tasks:
- Reads raw trade data from CSV files located in the `raw_data` directory.
- Cleans the data to focus on trade statistics between Spain and the USA.
- Adds metadata information such as TARIC code descriptions, country names, and province names.
- Generates a clean CSV file named `comex_clean.csv` containing the processed data.

### Usage:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Place raw trade data CSV files in the `raw_data` directory.
3. Execute the script using the command `python data_processing.py`.
4. The clean data file `comex_clean.csv` will be generated in the project directory.

## Tableau Dashboard:
The Tableau dashboard visualizes key trade metrics and trends between Spain and the USA.

### Dashboard Components:
1. **Annual Trade Balance and YoY:** Displays the annual trade balance between Spain and the USA along with year-over-year changes.
2. **Annual Exports and YoY:** Visualizes annual exports from Spain to the USA and year-over-year changes.
3. **Annual Imports and YoY:** Visualizes annual imports from the USA to Spain and year-over-year changes.
4. **Monthly Evolution of Imports and Exports:** Tracks the monthly evolution of imports and exports between both countries.
5. **Main Goods Exported and Imported:** Highlights the main goods exported from Spain to the USA and imported from the USA to Spain in the current year.

### Data Source:
The Tableau dashboard utilizes the clean data file `comex_clean.csv` generated by the Python script.

### Instructions:
1. Ensure Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader is installed on your system.
2. Open the Tableau workbook file `trade_dashboard.twb`.
3. Connect the dashboard to the `comex_clean.csv` file as the data source.
4. Interact with the dashboard to explore trade statistics and trends between Spain and the USA.
